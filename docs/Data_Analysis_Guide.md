# Data Analysis and Visualization Guide

## Overview
This document explains the mathematical and statistical methods used for processing and visualizing vehicle diagnostic data.

## Data Processing Pipeline
1. Raw Data Collection
   - Sampling rates by sensor type
   - Data validation methods
   - Noise filtering techniques

2. Signal Processing
   ```python
   def kalman_filter(data, Q=1e-5, R=1e-2):
       # State transition matrix
       A = 1
       # Observation matrix
       H = 1
       # Initial state estimate
       x = data[0]
       # Initial estimate covariance
       P = 1
   ```

## Statistical Analysis
1. Moving Averages
   - Simple Moving Average (SMA)
   - Exponential Moving Average (EMA)
   - Weighted Moving Average (WMA)

2. Anomaly Detection
   ```python
   def z_score_anomaly(data, threshold=3):
       mean = np.mean(data)
       std = np.std(data)
       z_scores = [(y - mean) / std for y in data]
       return [abs(z) > threshold for z in z_scores]
   ```
